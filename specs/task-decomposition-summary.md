## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path
The critical path determines the minimum project completion time:

**Task 1.1** → **Task 1.2** → **Task 2.1** → **Task 2.2** → **Task 2.3** → **Task 2.5** → **Task 3.3**

**Critical Path Duration**: ~6-8 days (assuming sequential execution)

### Dependency Graph
```
Task 1.1 (Project Setup)
├── Task 1.2 (Type Definitions) 
│   ├── Task 2.1 (API Route)
│   └── Task 2.2 (Extension Base)
│       ├── Task 2.3 (Request Management)
│       └── Task 2.4 (Keyboard Events)
└── Task 1.3 (Project Structure)

Task 2.1 + Task 2.2 + Task 2.3 → Task 2.5 (React Components)
Task 1.1 → Task 2.6 (Testing Setup)

Testing Phase Dependencies:
- Task 3.1 ← Task 2.1 + Task 2.6
- Task 3.2 ← Task 2.2 + Task 2.3 + Task 2.4 + Task 2.6  
- Task 3.3 ← Task 2.5 + Task 2.6
- Task 3.4 ← Task 2.1 + Task 2.5 + Task 2.6
```

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### High Parallelization Potential
The task structure allows significant parallel execution to reduce total project time:

#### After Task 1.1 (Project Setup):
- **Task 1.2** and **Task 1.3** can run in parallel

#### After Task 1.2 (Type Definitions):
- **Task 2.1** and **Task 2.2** can run in parallel

#### After Task 2.2 (Extension Base):
- **Task 2.3** and **Task 2.4** can run in parallel

#### Testing Phase (after dependencies met):
- **All testing tasks (3.1-3.4)** can run in parallel

### Optimized Execution Timeline
With parallel execution, the project can be completed in **4-5 days** instead of 8-12 days:

```
Day 1: Task 1.1 (blocks everything else)
Day 2: Task 1.2 + Task 1.3 (parallel)
Day 3: Task 2.1 + Task 2.2 + Task 2.6 (parallel)  
Day 4: Task 2.3 + Task 2.4 + Task 2.5 (parallel)
Day 5: Task 3.1 + Task 3.2 + Task 3.3 + Task 3.4 (parallel)
```

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

#### 1. AI SDK Integration (Task 2.1)
**Risk**: Complex streaming API integration with Gemini model
**Mitigation**: 
- Comprehensive mocking strategy for testing
- Fallback error handling for service unavailability
- Timeout mechanisms (500ms hard limit)

#### 2. ProseMirror Plugin Complexity (Task 2.2, 2.3)
**Risk**: Complex state management and decoration system
**Mitigation**:
- Follow established Tiptap extension patterns  
- Extensive unit testing of plugin state transitions
- Resource cleanup patterns to prevent memory leaks

#### 3. Cross-browser IME Compatibility (Task 2.4)
**Risk**: Input Method Editor (IME) behavior varies across browsers
**Mitigation**:
- Multiple detection methods (composing state, keyCode 229, isComposing)
- Cross-browser testing matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Conservative IME handling to prevent premature triggers

#### 4. Performance Requirements (All API Tasks)
**Risk**: <200ms latency target may be challenging
**Mitigation**:
- Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite model specifically chosen for speed
- Request caching with LRU eviction (50 item cache)
- Debouncing to prevent API spam (120ms default)
- Performance monitoring in integration tests

### Medium Risk Areas

#### 1. React Resource Management (Task 2.5)
**Risk**: Memory leaks from improper cleanup
**Mitigation**:
- AbortController for fetch cancellation
- useEffect cleanup functions
- Editor destruction on unmount

#### 2. Testing Complexity (Phase 3)
**Risk**: Mocking ProseMirror/Tiptap is complex
**Mitigation**:
- Custom test utilities and helpers
- Realistic mocks that simulate actual behavior
- Integration tests to catch mock-reality gaps

### Low Risk Areas

#### 1. Type System Implementation (Task 1.2)
**Risk**: TypeScript compilation issues
**Mitigation**: Branded types and comprehensive interfaces already proven

#### 2. Project Setup (Task 1.1, 1.3)  
**Risk**: Environment configuration issues
**Mitigation**: Standard Next.js patterns with documented dependencies

- ✅ All unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- ✅ Integration tests demonstrate <200ms response times  
- ✅ Cross-browser testing validates IME compatibility
- ✅ Error boundaries handle all failure scenarios gracefully
